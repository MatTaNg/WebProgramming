This was a project that I worked on in my Artificial Intellligence class.  It's a natural language interpreter which uses PHP to communicate with a SQL database to interpret the english language.  It compares key words in the sentence with the database.  As it interprets the sentence it sets off flags which helps it to respond back with a new sentence.  It was based off Cleverbot but only has an understanding of beers.  It can answer mostly any question you give it as long as its about beers.
