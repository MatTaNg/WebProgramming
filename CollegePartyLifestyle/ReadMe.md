This was my first website that I created using HTML/CSS, PHP and MySQL.  I created it for a startup company I was apart of where we would write articles on fashion trends, beers, school and basically anything a college student would be interested in.  It includes a search bar, a subscribe box and the content is generated through the database.  PHP pulls the information from the MySQL database and simply prints out the proper HTML for the page.
